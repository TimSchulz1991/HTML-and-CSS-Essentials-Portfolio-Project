# Preglife Connect

Preglife Connect is a mobile application for parents and expecting parents in which users can find friends, who are in similar stages of their parenthood or pregnancy. 

The purpose of this website is to inform potential users about the application and present its features, to make it easy for them to download the app, to learn more about the team behind the project, and to be able to contact the developers with any kind of questions or feedback. The page has been designed responsively for all screen sizes and the individual sections follow each other in a structured manner, so that anyone visiting gets an immediate overview of what Preglife Connect is about.

## User Experience (UX)
- ### User Stories
    1. #### First Time Visitor Goals
        - As a first time visitor, I want to quickly understand what Preglife Connect is all about and if it is relevant for me by browsing through the existing features.
        - As a first time visitor, I want to be able to immediately download the app if I am interested.
        - As a first time visitor, I want to see what users users have to say about the app and how it has helped them.
        - As a first time visitor, I want to learn more about the team behind the project.
        

    2. #### Returning Visitor Goals
        - As a returning visitor, I want to be able to give my feedback or ask questions about the app to the developers.
        - As a returning visitor, I want to find the app's social media links.
        

- ### Design
    - #### Color Scheme
        - The three main colors used on the page are the official main colors of the Preglife Connect app - a type of violet (#3E2D41), of pink (#EA6D7) and of ros√© (#F4C7C5).
    
    - #### Typography
        - The main font used on the website is 'Cabin', with a fallback font of Sans Serif, in case the font isn't imported correctly. Headings use the font 'Roboto Condensed'. This is a compatible font pair according to [this](https://reliablepsd.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/) website. To further highlight my H1 element, I used a third font called 'Staatliches'.

    - #### Imagery
        - The images of the website are important to quickly convey the purpose and the main target group of the app to a visitor. [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) was used to find an appropriate hero image to achieve that goal. The website was used again for the testimonial image of a potential user. All other image files are property of and created by the company behind Preglife Connect.

- ### Wireframes
    - #### Header and Hero Section
    ![This wireframe shows the Header and Hero section outline](/documentation/wireframes/hero-wireframe.png)
    <br/>
    I decided to omit the app screenshots in this section, as they are following directly in the next section. Instead, I centered the H1 and H2 elements and the download buttons for an even better exposure.

    - #### Feature Section
    ![This wireframe shows the Feature section outline](/documentation/wireframes/feature-wireframe.png)
    <br/>
    I decided to only include the three main features/functionalities as screenshots.

    - #### Testimonial Section
    ![This wireframe shows the Testimonial section outline](/documentation/wireframes/testimonial-wireframe.png)
    <br/>
    I decided to only show one testimonial and no slider, as this would have forced me to use JavaScript (according to my research).

    - #### Team Section
    ![This wireframe shows the Team section outline](/documentation/wireframes/team-wireframe.png)

    - #### Contact and Footer Section

## Features
In the following section, I will give a brief overview of all the features of the page. All of them are responsive on all device sizes.

- ### Navigation Bar and Hero Section
    - The navigation bar is located under the app logo on smaller screen sizes and on the top right side of the screen on larger screen sizes. It contains three links to the Features section, the Team section and to the Contact form section, so that visitors have an easy time navigating on the page. When clicking the app logo, the whole page is reloaded. 
    - The hero section has a friendly image of a mother with her child in the background. For better readability of the elements on the foreground, a color overlay with one of the corporate colors was implemented. The H1 and H2 text clearly describes the target audience of the app and prompts the visitor to download. The download buttons below lead the visitor directly to the AppStore or GooglePlay Store (opens in a new tab on desktop or opens the store app on mobile).
    ![This screenshot shows the Header and Hero section screenshot on a desktop screen](/documentation/feature-screenshots/hero.png)

- ### Feature Section 
    - The feature section shows screenshots of our three most important features/functionalities in the app - the swipe feature, the filter feature and the fourm feature - and describes thoroughly what each features can help the user with. On smaller screens, the individual features are layed out on top of each other, so that the user can still see a relatively large screenshot. When hovering over a screenshot (on a laptop or desktop screen), the size of it increases.
    ![This screenshot shows the Feature section screenshot on a desktop screen](/documentation/feature-screenshots/feature.png)

- ### Testimonial Section
    - This section is showing the positive experience that another user has had with our application in order to motivate website visitors to also download our app and subsequently (hopefully) have similar experiences.
    ![This screenshot shows the Testimonial section screenshot on a desktop screen](/documentation/feature-screenshots/testimonial.png)

- ### Team Section
    - This section is showing the team members behind the app, so that a user understands that this application was not created by a large company, but instead by a small startup company. For consistency reasons, the images are all black and white, but they become colored when hovering over them (on a laptop or desktop screen). On smaller screens, the individual team members are layed out on top of each other, so that each team member's picture is large enough to view properly.
    ![This screenshot shows the Team section screenshot on a desktop screen](/documentation/feature-screenshots/team.png)

- ### Contact Section and Footer
    - The contact section provides a simple way for the visitor to tell us about their feedback or questions regarding the app.
    - The footer gives the visitor a button to simply scroll back to the top of the page, which is improving the overall usability of the page. Furthermore, the user can get forwarded to our social media pages on Facebook and Instagram (which open in a new tab).

## Testing

### Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ftimschulz1991.github.io%2FHTML-and-CSS-Essentials-Portfolio-Project%2F)
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftimschulz1991.github.io%2FHTML-and-CSS-Essentials-Portfolio-Project%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=de)

### Feature Testing
- The navigation bar links work and bring the visitor to the correct section. Clicking the page logo reloads the whole page.
- The download buttons in the hero section open a new tab and bring the visitor to the app store for their respective device.
- The hover feature for the screenshots works well on desktop and laptop screens.
- The hover feature for the team members' pictures works well on desktop and laptop screens.
- The form has been tested thoroughly. Every section of the form is required. The email section is validated for a valid email input. The form is then sent to [this](https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/) website.
- The button in the footer correctly brings visitors back to the top of the page. The social links to Facebook and Instagram work as intended and open in a new tab.

### Further Testing
- The website was tested on Google Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, MacBook Pro, iPhone 8, iPhone 12 and iPad Air 2020.
- The responsiveness of all screen sizes was tested thoroughly on the actual devices (not only in the Chrome Development Tools). This led to small changes in the CSS code in order to achieve the perfect look/responsiveness on the actual devices. Furthermore, the [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) tool was used to test responsiveness on different devices.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all the links, buttons, input fields and hovering effects work correctly.
- Friends and family members (with design and programming backgrounds) were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Accessibility 
![This image shows the website's results from the Lighthouse tool in the Chrome Developer section](/documentation/testing/accessibility.png)
- The accessibility score which was calculated with the Lighthouse tool within the Chrome Developer tools shows that the website is highly accessible for screen readers.

### Known bugs
- On an iPhone X and upwards, when turning the phone into landscape mode, there are white edges on the left and right side of the page.
- The "smooth scrolling" back to the top as I intended it, does not work on mobile devices.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the correct [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TimSchulz1991/HTML-and-CSS-Essentials-Portfolio-Project)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Click on the Pages tab in the bottom of the navigation bar on the left.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "main".
5. Click on save and a link for the website will be created (with a blue background).
